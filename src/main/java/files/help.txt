This program starts up with an image preloaded that you may edit or save as you
see fit. However, it also has the option of importing images into the program,
which you can do by clicking "File" in the Top Menu Bar, and then clicking 
"Import Image". This will come up with a File Browser Prompt, in which you can
find the file you wish to edit, and then click on it, and click "Open". 
Depending on the resolution of the image, you may see a prompt asking you if you
would like to have the program automatically resize the image to fit your 
screen. It is recommend that you do this for ease of use, but if you do not 
choose "Yes" to this prompt, there are scroll bars in order to navigate the 
image as you please. Furthermore, there is still an option called "Fit to 
Screen" under the "Edit" tab in the Top Menu Bar, which will resize the image 
accordingly.
